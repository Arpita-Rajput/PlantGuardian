Plant Disease Detection System

Plant Disease Detection System is machine learning based project which is used to analyze images of plant leaves and automatically detect diseases. 
The main goal is to provide farmers and users with fast, reliable, and accurate diagnosis so they can maintain plant health and reduce crop losses.

How it works:

The user uploads a clear image of a plant leaf through a web or mobile interface.

Using advanced image processing and deep learning models (such as pre-trained CNNs), the system analyzes the unique features of the leafâ€”including color, shape, spots, and textures.

The model then predicts the disease (or confirms the plant is healthy) and provides relevant information, including possible remedies and best practices for plant care.
